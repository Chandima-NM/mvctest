# MVC TEST

MVC test is a super simple PHP base MVC framework. This framework is designed for SilverStripers PVT LTD to be used as a test material for the new developers. If you are a __developer__ candidate looking to work with us (SilverStripers PVT LTD), feel free to download the framework, install it on your machine and check the codes of it. Your PHP / MVC tests are going to be based on this framework. If you are not a __developer candidate__ but is checking out the framework, go ahead, if you can make any use of it :) .

### Deleveoper Selection Process

You will be given a random task to complete by using this framework. To install it on a server, configure a database, make a few controllers, and create / edit a few data, and depending on the test you are getting you will be asked to use AngularJS too. You will be asked to demonstrate your skills at our office within 3 hours. And to help you do that we have this code published.
